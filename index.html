            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Farmers are aware of the risks that come along with their job. The United States Department of Agriculture has a
                <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/risk-management/risk-in-agriculture" target="_blank">webpage dedicated to the five general risks</a>
                of agriculture. They cover uncertainties ranging from economic issues to health issues. I have chosen to focus my work on the “Human or personal risk,” and to take a closer look at the causes of specific health issues in farmers. The <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/" target="_blank">USDA Economic Research Service</a> writes:</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">Human or personal risk refers to factors such as problems with human health or personal relationships that can affect the farm business. Accidents, illness, death, and divorce are examples of personal crises that can threaten a farm business.</p>
            
            <p>What factors in agriculture may cause illness, and more specifically, cancer? </p>
            
            <p>One issue is long-term sun exposure, which puts farmers at an increased risk for skin cancer. Farmers are at extremely high risk for non-melanoma skin cancer because they are most exposed to ultraviolet radiation of all outdoor workers (Smit-Kroner &amp; Brumby, 2015). To fix this issue, scientific researchers are suggesting the implementation of education programs in farming communities to discuss the use of sunscreen and other sun protection measures.</p>
            
            <p>While the solution to increased rates of skin cancer is straightforward, there are many cancers for which researchers have not determined the root cause. There are countless studies pointing to a <b>relationship between pesticides and cancer in farmers</b>. A common study practice by many researchers has been looking at cancer incidences in a community of farmers, and then trying to link those to a specific chemical or other agricultural exposure. Another approach would be to analyze an agricultural chemical and determine which cancers could be caused by exposure.</p>
            
            <p>I have gathered a set of various research articles discussing the effects of agricultural chemical exposures on farmers and if those chemicals are directly linked to cancer, and will discuss their findings through this webpage.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Before beginning, here are a few keywords to know. (from Merriam-Webster):</p>

            <h2>Current Research</h2>
            <p>The research on agricultural exposures and its relationship to cancer has been somewhat inconclusive. There are many types of cancers to be studied, along with a wide variety of agricultural chemicals and toxins to be accounted for, that make this topic a complicated one.</p>
            
            <p>Some researchers have looked at farmer mortality as an overarching topic, considering all causes of death. The <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-014-0933-x" target="_blank">AGRICAN Cohort Study</a> researched a population of male and female farmers in France using data from 2005 to 2009, and found that the farmers were in healthier condition than the general population. Why? They had less incidences of smoking-related causes of death (lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases) (Leveque-Morlais, et al., 2015).</p>
            
            <p>From this data, one could argue that farmers are healthier because they get lots of physical exercise, tend to be non-smokers, and have various lifestyle habits that benefit them over time. However, there are many studies that take a closer look into the toxins and pesticides that farmers are exposed to which can negatively impact their health and the health of their family.</p>
            
            <p>In the 1995 study <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.95103s8205" target="_blank">“Agricultural Exposures and Cancer,”</a> the researchers found that despite having a “favorable mortality,” farmers appear to experience:</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">“elevated rates for several cancers, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and cancers of the skin, lip, stomach, brain, and prostate. The rates for several of these tumors (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, skin, brain, and prostate) appear to be increasing in the general population” (Blair and Zahm, 1995).</p>
            
            <p>Looking into these results, it seems as though no distinct set of factors can explain all the increased occurrences of cancers in farmers. The authors note that many of the cancers listed above are related to immunodeficiencies, which suggests there may be agricultural exposures that bring about immunodeficiencies in farmers.</p>
            
            <p>Knowing that farmers are exposed to “a variety of substances…including pesticides, engine exhausts, solvents, dusts, and zoonotic microbes” (Blair and Zahm, 1995), researchers have tried to identify which of these substances are causing specific health issues.</p>
            
            <p>For example, the study “Farming and Prostate Cancer Mortality” of 1993 attempts to determine why farmers appear to be at an increased risk of prostate cancer. The cohort study used data from the 1971 Canadian censuses of population and agriculture, and looked at the relation between the risk of dying from prostate cancer and a variety of agricultural exposures, including chickens, cattle, pesticides, and fuels. No farm exposure showed any statistically significant relationship, except for a weak association between <b>number of acres sprayed with herbicides and risk of prostate cancer mortality</b> (Morrison, et al., 1993).</p>
            
            <p>With a broad understanding of how agricultural exposures can impact farmers’ health, some researchers have sought to narrow the focus further. The study published in 2017 titled <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1295" target="_blank">“Insecticide Use and Breast Cancer Risk among Farmers’ Wives in the Agricultural Health Study”</a> finds that women who work in agricultural areas may experience significant exposure to a variety of harmful insecticides. The researchers focused on determining if there exists a relationship between insecticide use and breast cancer incidence. By examining data from the Agricultural Health Study, the researchers observed significant associations between breast cancer risk and the use of chlorpyrifos and terbufos (both ingredients used in pesticide products).</p>
            
            <p>Another example of narrowing the focus is by looking at the <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960103)65:1%3C39::AID-IJC8%3E3.0.CO;2-2" target="_blank">offspring of farmers</a> and those exposed to agricultural chemicals and toxins. Petter Kristensen, among other researchers, studied cancer risks and incidences in offspring of parents engaged in agricultural practices in Norway. In the 1996 study, they found that pesticide use can be linked to cancers in children at an early age, and factors in animal breeding (particularly poultry farming) are associated with cancers in later childhood and early adulthood. The researchers determined a variety of different cancers associated with different chemicals or agricultural practices, yet concluded that more research is necessary to support these findings (Kristensen, et al., 1996).</p>

            <h2>How has the literature succeeded?</h2>
            
            <h3>Study Design</h3>
            
            <p>The <a>”AGRIculture and CANcer (AGRICAN) Cohort Study”</a> achieved a successful study design that appeared fair and unbiased. The study was conducted through questionnaires sent to farmers in the cohort, and each individual had a follow-up once a year. The study collected mortality data from 2005 to 2009, which provides enough time to see various health trends occur. The authors of this study wrote a detailed break-down of the data they collected, including the characteristic of the enrolled individuals and how that may have affected the outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>The <a>”AGRICAN Study”</a> also mentioned the <b>healthy worker effect</b>, and described how they worked to minimize this.</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">The healthy worker effect is a type of bias in which the subjects that voluntarily enroll in a trial or study and actively participate are not representative of the general population (Shrank 2011).</p>
            
            <p>It is important that the researchers in the AGRICAN study sought to minimize this effect by enrolling not only active farm workers, but also those who have worked at least 3 years in agriculture in the “areas of concern,” including retired and non-retired individuals.</p>
            
            <h3>Sampling Methods</h3>
            
            <p>The <a>”AGRIculture and CANcer (AGRICAN) Cohort Study”</a> sampled a population that included all individuals working in agriculture (currently or in the past) that lived in 11 French areas covered by a 2004 population-based cancer registry. Eligible individuals needed to be at least 18 years old, insured by the MSA (French health insurance for agriculture), and live in one of the 11 regions covered by the study. This resulted in a population of 567,157 individuals. According to the researchers, these selected areas were “representative of agriculture in France.” This sampling population appears to be fair and representative of the overall farming population, and there was not a large gap between the representation of men and women (57% men, 43% women).</p>
            
            <h3>Study Ethics</h3>
            <p>The researchers of the AGRICAN study had it approved by the national ethics committee in France. Of the other articles I have read, none explicitly state that they were approved by an ethics committee. However, after reviewing the study design, all appear to be ethical. The questionnaires &amp; interviews are not harmful to the participants, and data collection is non-invasive and not physical as it comes from census records, medical records, or other databases. The studies are beneficial to the farmers involved, as this research may lead to finding solutions that can improve occupational safety in agriculture.</p>

        <section id="LiteratureCons" class="page-section">
            <h2>How can the literature improve?</h2>

            <h3>Study Design</h3>
            
            <p>In <a>“Agricultural Exposures and Cancer,”</a> Blair and Zahm point out that one of the major limitations of this type of research has been “lack of detail regarding exposure.” They go on to emphasize that the research is too generic, based primarily on the job title of “farmer,” and no specific exposure assessment is undertaken (Blair and Zahm, 1995). I have found this to be an issue among these research articles. The term “agricultural exposure” is incredibly broad, and the same goes for cancer. An improvement could be made by <b>narrowing the focus of individual studies</b> by selecting a specific cancer or a specific agricultural substance to be the main topic of study.</p>
            
            <p>Without a narrowed focus, researchers find themselves with a large set of data that covers a wide range of health issues and farming practices for various groups of people. This became a problem in the study titled: <a>“Cancer in Offspring of Parents Engaged in Agricultural Activities in Norway: Incidence and Risk Factors in the Farm Environment.”</a> The researchers wrote that the main issue with such a “large cohort study is the crude exposure indicators available,” which they had used for exposure classification in their Poisson regression analysis. For example, the researchers had very little information regarding pesticide use, so they had to make assumptions based on money spent for pesticides by farmers. <b>Making assumptions can potentially invalidate the researchers’ findings,</b> so future research would benefit from better data samples.</p>
            
            <p>In the AGRICAN study, the researchers collected data using detailed questionnaires for the participants to self-report. The same method was used in the <a>“Insecticide Use and Breast Cancer Risk Among Farmers’ Wives”</a> study. Pesticide exposure information was obtained at enrollment and at a 5-year follow-up interview (Engel, et al., 2017). While these appear to be detailed interviews and questionnaires, we must always be cognizant of the possibility of human error. If a participant is asked “how many days did you use x pesticide last week?”, they may not remember and will have give an estimated answer. It is important to reduce this risk as much as possible, such as by providing a tracking method that the participants could use to keep track of information about their pesticide use.</p>
            
            <h3>Sampling Methods</h3>
            
            <p>It is important that the population being sampled for agricultural exposure studies has experienced a substantial amount of time in an agricultural environment. When sampling for studies, researchers may overlook this important factor so they can get a larger population. However, this may invalidate the data. For example, the cancer in offspring study (previously mentioned), noted that it is possible that some subjects could have had parents who were not farmers at the time of birth. This is an important factor, because the point of the study is to observe if farmers’ children are affected by their parents’ farming exposures. The authors claim that this problem “is not likely to be substantial,” but it hurts the validity of their results.</p>

            <h2>Further Research</h2>
            <h3>What direction should further research go in?</h3>
            <p>While there is evidence that agricultural exposures such as pesticides and various toxins are harmful to farmers health, we are still unclear about many things. Which substances cause which health issues? Is cancer a likely outcome from pesticide use?</p>
            <p>Further research should narrow the focus: study a specific agricultural chemical and how it affects farmers over time. Or maybe a specific practice, like raising chickens, is causing negative health effects. In that case, what part of raising chickens is harmful?</p>
            <p>Another direction that I'd like to see research go in is looking closely at farmers' offspring. For example, is pesticide exposure causing genetic mutations that can be passed down through generations?</p>
            <p>Despite the varying results from research thus far, there is substantial evidence that points to a relationship between pesticide use and and increased risk of cancer in farmers. In addition to harming farmers, pesticides also have detrimental effects on the environment. Pesticides are substances with overall negative effects. <b>Decreasing pesticide use would most likely decrease the risk of cancer in farmers.</b></p>
