            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Farmers are aware of the risks that come along with their job. The United States Department of Agriculture has a
                <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/risk-management/risk-in-agriculture#:~:text=Five%20general%20types%20of%20risk,and%20human%20or%20personal%20risk." target="_blank">webpage dedicated to the five general risks</a>
                of agriculture. They cover uncertainties ranging from economic issues to health issues. I have chosen to focus my work on the “Human or personal risk,” and to take a closer look at the causes of specific health issues in farmers. The <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/" target="_blank">USDA Economic Research Service</a> writes:</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">Human or personal risk refers to factors such as problems with human health or personal relationships that can affect the farm business. Accidents, illness, death, and divorce are examples of personal crises that can threaten a farm business.</p>
            
            <p>What factors in agriculture may cause illness, and more specifically, cancer? </p>
            
            <p>One issue is long-term sun exposure, which puts farmers at an increased risk for skin cancer. Farmers are at extremely high risk for non-melanoma skin cancer because they are most exposed to ultraviolet radiation of all outdoor workers (Smit-Kroner &amp; Brumby, 2015). To fix this issue, scientific researchers are suggesting the implementation of education programs in farming communities to discuss the use of sunscreen and other sun protection measures.</p>
            
            <p>While the solution to increased rates of skin cancer is straightforward, there are many cancers for which researchers have not determined the root cause. There are countless studies pointing to a <b>relationship between pesticides and cancer in farmers</b>. A common study practice by many researchers has been looking at cancer incidences in a community of farmers, and then trying to link those to a specific chemical or other agricultural exposure. Another approach would be to analyze an agricultural chemical and determine which cancers could be caused by exposure.</p>
            
            <p>I have gathered a set of various research articles discussing the effects of agricultural chemical exposures on farmers and if those chemicals are directly linked to cancer, and will discuss their findings through this webpage.</p>

            <h2>Current Research</h2>
            <p>The research on agricultural exposures and its relationship to cancer has been somewhat inconclusive. There are many types of cancers to be studied, along with a wide variety of agricultural chemicals and toxins to be accounted for, that make this topic a complicated one.</p>
            
            <p>Some researchers have looked at farmer mortality as an overarching topic, considering all causes of death. The <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-014-0933-x" target="_blank">AGRICAN Cohort Study</a> researched a population of male and female farmers in France using data from 2005 to 2009, and found that the farmers were in healthier condition than the general population. Why? They had less incidences of smoking-related causes of death (lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases) (Leveque-Morlais, et al., 2015).</p>
            
            <p>From this data, one could argue that farmers are healthier because they get lots of physical exercise, tend to be non-smokers, and have various lifestyle habits that benefit them over time. However, there are many studies that take a closer look into the toxins and pesticides that farmers are exposed to which can negatively impact their health and the health of their family.</p>
            
            <p>In the 1995 study <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.95103s8205" target="_blank">“Agricultural Exposures and Cancer,”</a> the researchers found that despite having a “favorable mortality,” farmers appear to experience:</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">“elevated rates for several cancers, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and cancers of the skin, lip, stomach, brain, and prostate. The rates for several of these tumors (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, skin, brain, and prostate) appear to be increasing in the general population” (Blair and Zahm, 1995).</p>
            
            <p>Looking into these results, it seems as though no distinct set of factors can explain all the increased occurrences of cancers in farmers. The authors note that many of the cancers listed above are related to immunodeficiencies, which suggests there may be agricultural exposures that bring about immunodeficiencies in farmers.</p>
            
            <p>Knowing that farmers are exposed to “a variety of substances…including pesticides, engine exhausts, solvents, dusts, and zoonotic microbes” (Blair and Zahm, 1995), researchers have tried to identify which of these substances are causing specific health issues.</p>
            
            <p>For example, the study “Farming and Prostate Cancer Mortality” of 1993 attempts to determine why farmers appear to be at an increased risk of prostate cancer. The cohort study used data from the 1971 Canadian censuses of population and agriculture, and looked at the relation between the risk of dying from prostate cancer and a variety of agricultural exposures, including chickens, cattle, pesticides, and fuels. No farm exposure showed any statistically significant relationship, except for a weak association between <b>number of acres sprayed with herbicides and risk of prostate cancer mortality</b> (Morrison, et al., 1993).</p>
            
            <p>With a broad understanding of how agricultural exposures can impact farmers’ health, some researchers have sought to narrow the focus further. The study published in 2017 titled <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1295" target="_blank">“Insecticide Use and Breast Cancer Risk among Farmers’ Wives in the Agricultural Health Study”</a> finds that women who work in agricultural areas may experience significant exposure to a variety of harmful insecticides. The researchers focused on determining if there exists a relationship between insecticide use and breast cancer incidence. By examining data from the Agricultural Health Study, the researchers observed significant associations between breast cancer risk and the use of chlorpyrifos and terbufos (both ingredients used in pesticide products).</p>
            
            <p>Another example of narrowing the focus is by looking at the <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960103)65:1%3C39::AID-IJC8%3E3.0.CO;2-2" target="_blank">offspring of farmers</a> and those exposed to agricultural chemicals and toxins. Petter Kristensen, among other researchers, studied cancer risks and incidences in offspring of parents engaged in agricultural practices in Norway. In the 1996 study, they found that pesticide use can be linked to cancers in children at an early age, and factors in animal breeding (particularly poultry farming) are associated with cancers in later childhood and early adulthood. The researchers determined a variety of different cancers associated with different chemicals or agricultural practices, yet concluded that more research is necessary to support these findings (Kristensen, et al., 1996).</p>
