            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Farmers are aware of the risks that come along with their job. The United States Department of Agriculture has a <a class="article-link" href="" target="_blank">webpage dedicated to the five general risks</a> of agriculture. They cover uncertainties ranging from economic issues to health issues. I have chosen to focus my work on the “Human or personal risk,” and to take a closer look at the causes of specific health issues in farmers. The <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/" target="_blank">USDA Economic Research Service</a> writes:</p>
            
            <p class="quote-block">Human or personal risk refers to factors such as problems with human health or personal relationships that can affect the farm business. Accidents, illness, death, and divorce are examples of personal crises that can threaten a farm business.</p>
            
            <p>What factors in agriculture may cause illness, and more specifically, cancer? </p>
            
            <p>One issue is long-term sun exposure, which puts farmers at an increased risk for skin cancer. Farmers are at extremely high risk for non-melanoma skin cancer because they are most exposed to ultraviolet radiation of all outdoor workers <a class="article-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2015.07.004" target="_blank">(Smit-Kroner &amp; Brumby, 2015)</a>. To fix this issue, scientific researchers are suggesting the implementation of education programs in farming communities to discuss the use of sunscreen and other sun protection measures.</p>
            
            <p>While the solution to increased rates of skin cancer is straightforward, there are many cancers for which researchers have not determined the root cause. There are countless studies pointing to a <b>relationship between pesticides and cancer in farmers</b>. A common study practice by many researchers has been looking at cancer incidences in a community of farmers, and then trying to link those to a specific chemical or other agricultural exposure. Another approach would be to analyze an agricultural chemical and determine which cancers could be caused by exposure.</p>
            
            <p>I have gathered a set of various research articles discussing the effects of agricultural chemical exposures on farmers and if those chemicals are directly linked to cancer, and will discuss their findings through this webpage.</p>
